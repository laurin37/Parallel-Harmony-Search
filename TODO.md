# task steps to achive better parallelization
1. partition problem into tasks
2. identify communication chanells between tasks
3. aggregate tasks into composite tasks
4. map composite tasks into cores.

# General tasks
- generate pseudocode of parallelized implementation


# Improvements
- reading user input
- divide the load on the collector node
    * use split communications -> tree structured or MPI reduce
